# üçΩÔ∏è RESTAURANT-REVIEW-PROCESSING-USING-NLP
üöÄ Built an NLP pipeline to classify hotel reviews as positive/negative using NLTK + ML. Implemented KNN, Naive Bayes &amp; SVM, with SVM achieving best performance (~83% F1). Includes preprocessing, Bag of Words, and GridSearchCV tuning. Perfect for feedback analysis!

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on hotel/restaurant reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and machine learning classifiers.
The dataset (`Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`) contains reviews labeled as **positive (1)** or **negative (0)**.

The pipeline involves:

1. **Text Preprocessing**
2. **Feature Extraction (Bag of Words)**
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

## üìÇ Dataset

* File: `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv`
* Columns:

  * `Review`: The review text.
  * `Liked`: Target label (1 = Positive, 0 = Negative).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install dependencies before running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk openpyxl
```

Additionally, download NLTK stopwords:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("stopwords")
```

---

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* Removes punctuation, numbers, and special characters.
* Converts text to lowercase.
* Tokenizes and removes stopwords.
* Applies **PorterStemmer** to reduce words to their root forms.
* Example:

  ```
  "The food was amazing and loved it!" ‚Üí "food amaz love"
  ```

### 2. **Feature Extraction**

* Uses **CountVectorizer** (Bag of Words).
* Keeps the **top 1500 most frequent words** (`max_features=1500`).

### 3. **Model Training**

Trains and compares three models:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
* **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)**
* **Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**

Each model is evaluated using:

* **Accuracy**
* **Precision**
* **Recall**
* **F1-score**
* **Confusion Matrix**

The best model is selected based on **F1-score**.

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**

Uses **GridSearchCV** with 5-fold cross-validation:

* **KNN**

  ```python
  "n_neighbors": [2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 15],
  "metric": "minkowski",
  "p": [1, 2]
  ```
* **MultinomialNB**

  ```python
  "alpha": [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
  ```
* **SVC**

  ```python
  "C": [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10],
  "max_iter": [1000, 5000, 10000]
  ```

The tuned model‚Äôs performance is evaluated on the test set.
